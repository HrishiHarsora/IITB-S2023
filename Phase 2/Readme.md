## Phase 2

This Phase of my work was done by using Quantum Espresso codes. 

After using a denser k-point grid(and using the unit cells for which data was available in the literature), the band gaps did come out to be within a good range of the values reported in literature. 

The considerably smaller support community of Abinit codes wasn't able to answer my doubts. This pushed me to look for different approaches. As a result, I learnt of the amazing cloud based approaches, most notably Materials Square. 

The following Links to my work on Materials Square has the input and corresponding output files for the calculations, including the Band Structure and DOS Plots:
