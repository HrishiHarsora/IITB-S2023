This Phase of my work was dome on Abinit. However, towards the end (in order to exerience cloud based approaches) I ran the SCF, Band Strcuture and DOS calculations on cloud platforms such as Materials Square and Mat3ra.


After having gained the experience of writing input files from scratch, feeding them as an argument to the Abinit source code and correcting the numerous errors that I made in that learning phase, and trying to plot the band structures by using Python codes(failed to do so due to an weird error), I was genuinely surprised by the ease with which the cloud platforms could be used
