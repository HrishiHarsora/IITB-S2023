## Phase 2

This Phase of my work was done by using Quantum Espresso codes. After continuing to use Abinit codes for a while, the smaller support community wasn't able to support my doubts, which pushed me to look for other approaches. As a result, I learnt about cloud based tools such as MaterialsSquare and others. 

After using a denser k-point grid(and using the unit cells for which data was available in the literature), the band gaps did come out to be within a good range of the values reported in literature.
