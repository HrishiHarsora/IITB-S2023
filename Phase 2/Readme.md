This Phase of my work was dome on Abinit. However, towards the end (in order to exerience cloud based approaches) I ran the SCF, Band Strcuture and DOS calculations on cloud platforms such as Materials Square and Mat3ra.

After using a denser k-point grid(and using the unit cells for which data was available in the literature), the band gaps did come out to be within a good range of the values reported in literature.
