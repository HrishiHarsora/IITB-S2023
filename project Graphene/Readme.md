With the help of a CIF File from materials project, I wrote the input file Graphene_Input.abi. After running this input file as an argument to Abinit code, the output file Graphene_Output.abo file was obtained. 

After altering the input file to account for band structure calculation, the file Graphene_BandStructure.abi is created. the output file obtained in this case is Graphene_BandStructure.abo. Upon processing the Graphene.nc file, the following 
band structure was obtained a photo of which is also included.
