During my internship at IIT Bombay, after completing the DFT calculations, I was introduced to the issue of exchange-correlation functionals and their role in band gap underestimation. As the internship was coming to an end and with college about to start, the professor directed me to focus on understanding this problem further. Rather than assigning any additional tasks, he encouraged me to read more about exchange-correlation functionals on my own. This gave me time to delve into the subject independently, marking a thoughtful conclusion to my internship.
