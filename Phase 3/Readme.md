This last phase of my work under Prof. Shukla was mainly an independent study of exchange correlation functionals. After obtaining band gaps within an agreeable range of the values reported in literature, I noticed the underestimation of the values and, although I earlier perceived it to be perfectly normal, learnt that this is something that is to be expected whilst using PBE functionals to estimate the energy. Prof. Shukla then pointed me to investigate this issue independently. He motivated this independent study whilst not giving any further assignments.

The Text Files in this folder are representative of my learning in this last phase.
