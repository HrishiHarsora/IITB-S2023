With the help of a CIF File from materials project, I wrote the input file Boron_Nitride_Input.abi. After running this input file as an argument to Abinit code, the output file Boron_Nitride_Output.abo file was obtained.

After altering the input file to account for band structure calculation, the file Boron_Nitride_BandStructure.abi is created. the output file obtained in this case is Boron_Nitride_BandStructure.abo.
