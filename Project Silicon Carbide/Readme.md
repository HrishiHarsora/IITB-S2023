With the help of a CIF File from materials project, I wrote the input file Silicon_Carbide_Input.abi. After running this input file as an argument to Abinit code, the output file Silicon_Carbide_Output.abo file was obtained.

After altering the input file to account for band structure calculation, the file Silicon_Carbide_BandStructure.abi is created. the output file obtained in this case is Silicon_Carbide_BandStructure.abo. Upon processing the Silicon_Carbide.nc file, the following band structure was obtained a photo of which is also included.
